            I authorize you to make investigations (including contacting current

            arriving at an employment decision. I hereby release employers,
            schools, health care providers, and other persons from all liability

            and/or prior employers may be used, and those employer(s) will be
            contacted for the purpose of investigating my safety performance
            history as required by 49 CFR 391.23. I understand that I have the
            right to review information, have errors corrected, and attach a
            rebuttal statement where applicable.
